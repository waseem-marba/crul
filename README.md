<h1>My Review about this implementation</h1>

I implemented this task in custom PHP OOPs pattern. For now i just focused on classes and there association regarding this problem, so that reviewer get idea that how i create classes and associate them. Further more there are certain limitations in my implementation Like for example<br/>
a) I only implement get method in Http class, other methods like post,put,patch and delete not implemented because in task problem was only to call api and print there response.<br/>
b) I used inlcude php statement to include classes, we can use PHP autoload mechanisam to make it more professional.<br/>
c) For now i just focus on positive case scenarios, and did not implement PHP Exceptions. I have full idea about it but not implemented in this task, as i was just focused on parsing and calling apis.<br/><br/>

By above 3 points we can make it more better and professional. As there is always space of improvements in any code.
